Below is a tightened, more execution-ready Phase 1 plan that’s better aligned with the **current repo reality** (Python-only pipeline + existing `dashboard/`, `run_dashboard.py`, SQLite `signals.db`, and an existing test/verification layer). ([GitHub][1])

I’ve kept your 6-week frame, but added the missing “product glue” (triage + notes + saved views + freshness + audit), clarified the data contract, and put hard guardrails around the network UI so it doesn’t become a graph-viz science project.

---

## 0. What’s different in this improved plan

**Key upgrades vs your current draft**

* **Data contract first**: treat `signals.db` as an internal store; expose a stable, versioned API schema (Pydantic) that won’t break whenever ingestion changes. ([GitHub][1])
* **Read-only core + separate “user metadata” store**: notes/tags/status should not be shoved into ingestion tables (or you’ll create merge/locking headaches). Start with a tiny `app.db` (SQLite) or Postgres later.
* **MVP workflow ≠ “view data”**: add triage states, suppress/snooze, notes, tags, saved filters, and “freshness/last-seen” so it actually replaces the Streamlit workflow.
* **Network scope guardrails**: Phase 1 shows *connection paths* and *shared entities* (employers/schools/domains). Fancy graph visualization becomes Phase 2 unless you have clean relationship data.

---

## 1. Team & Roles (slightly adjusted)

* **Project Lead (1)**: backlog grooming, scope policing, stakeholder demos, release owner.
* **Frontend Dev (1–2)**: Next.js app, component library, list/detail views, network UI v1.
* **Backend Dev (1)**: FastAPI, read models, query layer, auth middleware, app-metadata store.
* **UI/UX (part-time)**: week 1 wireframes + design tokens; week 3 usability pass.
* **(Optional but high leverage) QA/Release (0.25 FTE)**: test plan + smoke automation + release checklist.

---

## 2. Architectural Decisions (Week 1, Day 1–2)

### 2.1 Repo Reality Check (grounded)

Current repo already has:

* Pipeline + ingestion components (`collectors/`, `connectors/`, `discovery_engine/`, `workflows/`) ([GitHub][1])
* Dashboard entrypoint (`dashboard/`, `run_dashboard.py`) ([GitHub][1])
* SQLite databases (`signals.db`, `example_signals.db`, `integration_test.db`) ([GitHub][1])
* Tests + verification artifacts (`tests/`, `verification/`, `test_schema_validation.py`, `test_suppression_sync.py`) ([GitHub][1])

### 2.2 Recommended MVP architecture

**Two DBs, one API contract**

* **Ingestion DB**: existing `signals.db` (read-only from the app).
* **App DB**: new `app.db` for *user-generated metadata* (notes/tags/status/snoozes/saved views/audit events).
* **FastAPI**: the only component that touches either DB.
* **Next.js**: talks to FastAPI only (no direct DB).

This avoids the classic “we added columns to ingestion tables for notes and now ingestion jobs break/lock the DB.”

### 2.3 Auth choice (reduce risk)

Pick **one**:

* **Fastest internal**: Google/GitHub SSO via NextAuth (frontend), API validates JWT.
* **Enterprise-ish**: Auth0/Clerk (faster UI integration, less DIY).
* **Ultra-minimal**: single shared login (not recommended unless tiny team + low sensitivity).

## 3. Phase 1 Sprint Plan (Weeks 1–6)

### Weeks 1–2: Foundation, Data Contract, Auth, Shell

**Goal:** “Hello product” with auth + navigation + stable API scaffolding + DB access patterns.

| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------: | ------------: | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1.1     | **Data contract + schema map**: enumerate tables/fields you need from `signals.db`; define `CompanySummary`, `CompanyDetail`, `Signal`, `Founder` Pydantic models; version under `/api/v1` |    Backend |             2 | OpenAPI renders clean; sample payloads validated in tests            |
| 1.2     | **Create FastAPI service** (new `app/api/` or `services/api/`)                                                                                                                             |    Backend |             1 | `/health`, `/version`, CORS, structured logging                      |
| 1.3     | **DB access layer**: read-only connection to `signals.db` + new `app.db` migrations (Alembic or bare SQL)                                                                                  |    Backend |             2 | Query functions covered by unit tests; WAL mode documented if SQLite |
| 1.4     | **Auth integration** (SSO + protected routes)                                                                                                                                              | Full Stack |           2–3 | Login/logout works; API rejects unauthenticated requests             |
| 1.5     | **Next.js app shell** (layout + routing + loading/error states)                                                                                                                            |   Frontend |             2 | Sidebar nav, top search bar stub, empty pages wired                  |
| 1.6     | **CI gates**: backend tests + lint; frontend typecheck + lint                                                                                                                              | Full Stack |           1–2 | Green CI on PR; basic pre-commit hooks optional                      |
| 1.7     | **UX baseline**: wireframes for list + detail + founder section + triage controls                                                                                                          |      UI/UX |             2 | Figma/figjam + component spec for dev                                |

**Deliverable (end of Week 2):**
Authenticated web shell + FastAPI running locally, plus a documented API contract and DB strategy.

### Weeks 3–4: Company List + Company Detail (the core product loop)

**Goal:** replace Streamlit for the primary workflow: find a company → assess → triage.

#### Add one missing product requirement: *triage metadata*

Without notes/tags/status/suppress/snooze, the app is a read-only viewer and won’t replace workflow.

| Task ID | Task Description                                                                |       Lead | Effort (Days) | Definition of Done                                                  |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------: | ------------: | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 2.1     | **Company list endpoint** `GET /api/v1/companies` with pagination, search, sort |    Backend |             2 | Handles `q`, `sort`, `page`, `filters`; performant enough for N=10k |
| 2.2     | **Company detail bundle** `GET /api/v1/companies/{id}`                          |    Backend |           1–2 | Returns summary + derived fields needed for UI                      |
| 2.3     | **Signals timeline** `GET /api/v1/companies/{id}/signals` with filters          |    Backend |           1–2 | Supports type/date filters; consistent ordering                     |
| 2.4     | **App metadata endpoints** (new): notes/tags/status/snooze/suppress             |    Backend |           2–3 | CRUD works; audit trail captures changes                            |
| 2.5     | **Company list UI** (table + filters + saved views)                             |   Frontend |           3–4 | Debounced search; filter chips; saved view persistence              |
| 2.6     | **Company detail page v1** (header + tabs)                                      |   Frontend |           2–3 | Summary, “last seen”, key signals, triage controls                  |
| 2.7     | **Timeline component** (grouped + collapsible)                                  |   Frontend |           2–3 | Supports filters + “copy link to signal”                            |
| 2.8     | **Freshness indicators**                                                        | Full Stack |             1 | “Last signal” + “last ingestion run” visible                        |

**Deliverable (end of Week 4):**
A user can search, open a company, review signals, and record a decision (status + notes) inside the new app.

---

### Weeks 5–6: Founder + Network Intelligence (scoped to “actionable”)

**Goal:** enrich the detail page with founders + “how are we connected?” without getting stuck in graph complexity.

| Task ID | Task Description                                                                          |       Lead | Effort (Days) | Definition of Done                                                       |
| ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------: | ------------: | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 3.1     | **Founder endpoints** `GET /api/v1/companies/{id}/founders` + `GET /api/v1/founders/{id}` |    Backend |           2–3 | Founder identity stable; supports multiple founders/company              |
| 3.2     | **Network v1 computation**: connection paths + shared entities                            |    Backend |           2–3 | Returns: `mutuals[]`, `shared_employers[]`, `shared_schools[]`, `path[]` |
| 3.3     | **Founder cards + tab** on company page                                                   |   Frontend |           2–3 | Profile view, experience list, key flags                                 |
| 3.4     | **Network UI v1** (NOT a full graph)                                                      |   Frontend |             2 | Shows “You’re connected via X” + top shared entities                     |
| 3.5     | **Hardening**: e2e smoke + perf pass + a11y basics                                        |  Full Team |           2–3 | Critical flows tested; slow queries identified + indexed                 |
| 3.6     | **Deployment** (staging → prod)                                                           | Full Stack |             2 | One-command deploy; env vars managed; rollback documented                |

**Deliverable (end of Week 6):**
Deployed MVP with company research + triage + founders + basic network intelligence.

---

## 4. “Company Detail Page” — what “data-rich” means (MVP spec)

**Header (always visible)**

* Company name, description, domains/links
* Status (New / Reviewing / Pass / Watch / Invest)
* Confidence + momentum (if you have them) + “last seen signal”
* Quick actions: add note, tag, suppress/snooze

**Tabs**

1. **Overview**: key signals summary + highlights + risk flags
2. **Signals**: timeline w/ filters and grouping
3. **Founders**: founder cards + experience + flags
4. **Network**: mutuals + connection paths + shared entities
5. **Activity**: audit trail of user actions (who changed status/notes)

---

## 5. API v1 (expanded to match real workflows)

### Read endpoints (from `signals.db`)

* `GET /api/v1/companies`
* `GET /api/v1/companies/{id}`
* `GET /api/v1/companies/{id}/signals`
* `GET /api/v1/companies/{id}/founders`
* `GET /api/v1/founders/{id}`
* `GET /api/v1/system/ingestion-runs` (or even just `last_run`)

### Write endpoints (to `app.db`)

* `POST /api/v1/companies/{id}/notes`
* `PUT /api/v1/companies/{id}/status`
* `POST /api/v1/companies/{id}/tags`
* `POST /api/v1/companies/{id}/snooze`
* `POST /api/v1/companies/{id}/suppress`
* `GET /api/v1/views` / `POST /api/v1/views` (saved filters)

---

## 6. Dependencies & Risks (more specific + mitigations)

### A) SQLite concurrency & locking (highest practical risk)

You’ll have ingestion writes + app reads. Mitigate by:

* App uses **read-only connections** to `signals.db`
* Enable **WAL mode** and sensible timeouts
* If pain persists: nightly copy to a read replica file, or Phase 2 migrate to Postgres

### B) “Network intelligence” data quality risk

If founders aren’t reliably normalized (names/LinkedIns/emails), network features get noisy fast.

* Mitigation: require one canonical key per founder (LinkedIn URL preferred) before showing “connections”
* Keep Phase 1 to **paths + shared entities**; graph viz later

### C) Scope creep in UI polish

* Mitigation: lock a component library early; insist on “usable > pretty” until Week 5 polish pass

### D) Auth complexity

* Mitigation: choose the simplest SSO that matches your team; don’t build user management in Phase 1

---

## 7. Success Metrics (tightened to “adoption + workflow replacement”)

By end of Week 6:

1. **Primary workflow replaced**: team uses the new app (not Streamlit) for 80%+ of “first look” research.
2. **Time-to-triage**: from search → decision recorded (status + note) in under 2 minutes for a known company.
3. **3-click goal** still holds (Home → Company → Signals/Founders) *and* includes triage action.
4. **Data freshness visible**: every page shows last signal + last ingestion run.
5. **Operational readiness**: staging + prod exist; rollback path documented; CI green.

---

## 8. Scope guardrails (what explicitly slips to Phase 2 if needed)

* Full interactive founder graph visualization
* CRM integrations (Affinity, HubSpot, etc.)
* Full-text search engine (Meilisearch/Elastic)
* Collaborative workflows (assignments, comments threads, notifications)
* Multi-tenant RBAC beyond “internal team”

---

If you want, I can also rewrite your original tables verbatim (same structure) but with the added tasks/DoD fields above—this version is meant to be directly implementable while staying realistic about what actually makes the app “replace Streamlit” in practice.
